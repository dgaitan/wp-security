## Commands

```bash
# Install / update PHP deps
composer install

composer lint-fix

# Static analysis (PHPStan level 6)
composer analyse

# Unit + integration tests
composer test

# Run all checks (lint → analyse → test)
composer check

npm run build          # production
npm run start          # watch / dev
npm run lint:js        # ESLint
```

## Architecture invariant — YOU MUST respect this

Every piece of auditing logic MUST follow the Module → Check → Finding chain:

1. A **Check** runs one focused, side-effect-free test and returns a **Finding**.
2. A **Module** is a thin container that declares identity and yields Checks.
3. Modules and individual Checks are registered through WordPress filters — never hard-coded:
   - `wp_security/modules` → register a whole Module.
   - `wp_security/checks/{module-id}` → add Checks to an existing Module.

Never bypass this chain. Never write scan logic directly in a controller or service.

---

## DRY — shared primitives

| What | Where | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Check result | `src/Domain/Finding.php` | Every check returns a `Finding`; never return raw arrays |
| Status values | `src/Domain/Status.php` | Use the `Status` enum; never hardcode status strings |
| Severity + penalty | `src/Domain/Severity.php` | Use the `Severity` enum; `penalty()` is the single source of scoring truth |
| Score calculation | `src/Scoring/ScoringService.php` | All module + overall scores come from here; no ad-hoc arithmetic |
| REST base | `src/Rest/AbstractController.php` | All controllers extend this; permission check + respond() live here |

---

## Security rules — non-negotiable

- **Read-only scans.** A Check MUST NOT mutate site data. Report and recommend; never auto-fix.
- **Capability check on every REST route.** All routes use `permissionCheck()` from `AbstractController`. Do not skip it.
- **`$wpdb->prepare()` only.** No string-interpolated SQL anywhere in `src/`.
- **Escape all output.** Use `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `wp_kses_post()`, etc. Never echo raw user data.
- **Sanitize all input.** Use `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_email()`, `absint()`, etc. before storing or acting on any user-supplied value.
- **Secrets never returned to client.** API keys stored with `autoload = false`; only masked previews (`SG.••••`) sent in REST responses.

---

## Code style

- PHP 8.1+: typed properties, enums, `readonly`, `match`, named arguments.
- `declare(strict_types=1)` at the top of every PHP file.
- PSR-4 autoloading: namespace `WPSecurity\` maps to `src/`.
- WordPress Coding Standards (PHPCS `WordPress` + `WordPress-Extra`).
- All user-facing strings wrapped in `__()` / `esc_html__()` with text domain `wp-security`.

---

## Styles

**No inline styles permitted.** Every visual concern belongs in SCSS.

- SCSS files live in `assets/app/styles/`.
- Entry point: `assets/app/styles/index.scss` — imported from `assets/app/index.jsx`.
- Partials follow the `_name.scss` convention and are `@use`d from `index.scss`.
- All class names are prefixed `wpsec-` to avoid collisions with wp-admin.
- BEM naming: `wpsec-block`, `wpsec-block__element`, `wpsec-block--modifier`.
- Variables (colours, spacing, typography) live in `_variables.scss`; always `@use 'variables' as *` in partials that need them.
- Dynamic colours (e.g. per-grade score colours) are expressed with `data-*` attribute selectors in SCSS — never as computed inline styles.
- `sass` and `sass-loader` ship with `@wordpress/scripts`; no separate install needed.
- `npm run build` outputs both `build/index.js` and `build/index.css`; `AdminPage::enqueueAssets()` enqueues the CSS automatically when `build/index.css` exists.

---

## Testing expectations

- Every new Check class gets a corresponding unit test in `tests/Unit/`.
- Unit tests mock `Context` — no WordPress installation needed.
- Integration tests in `tests/Integration/` cover REST endpoints and repositories.
- Run `composer check` before marking any sprint task done.

## When compacting

Preserve: the architecture invariant (Module → Check → Finding), the security rules list, the list of modified files in the current sprint, and any failing test output.
